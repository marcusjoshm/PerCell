PerCell4 is a desktop application for single-cell analysis of fluorescence microscopy
images, including fluorescence lifetime (FLIM) data. It combines Cellpose segmentation,
per-cell thresholding and puncta detection, per-cell measurement, and phasor analysis in
one workflow, and stores each experiment as a single HDF5 file. It is written in Python
and built on Qt, napari, scikit-image and h5py.

Every batch operation is also available as a headless command-line tool.

> PerCell4 is under active development. The current release is 0.4.0 (see
> [Versions](#versions)); interfaces and file layouts may still change between versions.

## Installation

PerCell4 requires Python 3.12 or newer. **Only Python 3.12 is tested** — newer versions
install and run, but are not verified. If you experience problems with a newer version of Python, reinstall with Python 3.12.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

See the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for per-OS instructions, optional
extras, PyTorch and Cellpose notes, standalone bundles, and troubleshooting.

## Usage

Launch the application:

```bash
percell4-gui
```

or

```bash
python main.py
```

The [workflow protocol](docs/workflow-protocol.md) walks through the single-cell
analysis workflow step by step, from importing `.tiff` exports through segmentation,
thresholding, and measurement.

Batch operations can also be run without a display:

```bash
percell4-inspect data/*.h5
percell4-batch-threshold data/*.h5 --round-name SG_mask --channel mNG \
    --strategy adaptive-clip --d-min-um 1.0
percell4-batch-measure data/*.h5 --mask SG_mask --output results/
```

See the [command-line reference](docs/cli.md) for all tools and options.

## Key features

- **Cell segmentation and tracking** — automated single-cell segmentation via Cellpose,
  and cell tracking via LapTrack.
- **Thresholding** — autothresholding (Otsu, Triangle, Li), optionally applied per group
  after clustering cells by their individual intensities (k-means or Gaussian mixture
  models), and a universal feature extraction method called
  [Adaptive Local Clipping](docs/adaptive-local-clipping.md).
- **FLIM and phasor analysis** — phasor analysis of TCSPC data with median and wavelet
  filtering, and segmentation by ROI: manual placement, derived from fluorescence
  lifetime values, or automated with a Gaussian mixture model.
- **Measurement and export** — configurable per-cell and per-particle measurements across
  every segmentation and mask, exported as CSV and TIFF files.
- **Batch workflows and analysis** — end-to-end analysis workflows and particle analysis,
  configured in the GUI or run from dedicated CLI tools.

## Versions

This repository holds the full history of PerCell. Each earlier generation was a separate
repository; they are available here as tags:

| Tag | Generation | What it was |
|---|---|---|
| `v0.1.0` | microscopy-analysis-single-cell (2025) | Command-line workflow for LAS X exports: Cellpose segmentation and per-cell analysis |
| `v0.2.0` | PerCell (2025–2026) | Cellpose plus ImageJ macros behind an interactive command-line interface |
| `v0.3.0` | PerCell3 (2026) | Platform built on OME-Zarr and SQLite, with Cellpose and napari |
| `v0.4.0` | PerCell4 (2026) | This application: a standalone GUI on HDF5 and pandas, and the base of current development |

To look at an earlier generation, check out its tag:

```bash
git checkout v0.2.0
```

The version the package reports comes from the nearest tag in the checkout's history:
`0.4.0` at the tag, `0.4.1.devN` on later commits. After a new tag, refresh an editable
install with `pip install -e .` so the reported version follows. The `development` branch
is a testing branch with no version tag in its history, so installs from it report a
placeholder such as `0.0.1.devN`.

## Reporting issues

PerCell4 is a developing project and reports are greatly appreciated! Questions and bug
reports are welcome in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/marcusjoshm/PerCell/issues).
Please include your operating system, Python version, and the output of
`percell4-inspect` for the dataset involved where relevant.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. [Writing an analysis](docs/writing_an_analysis.md) describes
how to add a new analysis module, and [the architecture notes](docs/architecture.md)
describe the code layout and how the test suite is organised.

Implementation plans, requirements documents, and the project's institutional
learnings live on the long-lived `development` branch rather than on `main`, so that
a clone of `main` stays about the software rather than about how it was built. See
[Development documentation](docs/architecture.md#development-documentation).
