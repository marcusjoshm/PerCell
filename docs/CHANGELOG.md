## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Paper-strict wavelet filter, with levers.** The FLIM tab's Wavelet
  Filter group gains a Method picker: *LeeLab reference* (the historical
  behaviour, unchanged to the bit) or *Paper (Wang 2021 BiShrink)*, a strict
  reading of Wang et al., Biomed. Opt. Express 12(6) 3463 and its supplement
  (`docs/reference/`). A *Show algorithm levers* toggle exposes every point
  where the two differ — which bands feed the MAD noise estimate, the power
  of σ in the threshold, whether the local variance divides the threshold or
  only gates it, the regulariser under the root, the window radius, the
  first-level basis, the Anscombe clamp order, the inverse-Anscombe flavour,
  and whether the coarsest level is shrunk — so each can be flipped on its
  own to see which piece moves a dataset (moving any lever relabels the
  method *Custom*). The variant is stamped on `g_filtered` as
  `wavelet_method` / `wavelet_params`, and Apply Wavelet recomputes when the
  cached variant differs from the requested one. `percell4-batch-phasor`
  takes the same choices via `--wavelet-method` and repeatable
  `--wavelet-param KEY=VALUE`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-10

PerCell4: a standalone desktop application on HDF5 and pandas, integrating Cellpose,
napari, and pyqtgraph for single-cell segmentation, tracking, thresholding, FLIM phasor
analysis, and measurement across timepoints and conditions. Everything below was
implemented between 2026-03 and 2026-09 under the working version `0.1.0`.

### 2026-07 – 2026-09 — Calibration from LAS X metadata, Cellpose 4.2, segmentation previews

#### Added

- **FLIM calibration from a `.xml` metadata export.** The Batch TCSPC
  dialog's calibration step now also accepts the `.xml` file written by the
  standalone `extract_lif_metadata` tool (the Windows exe that runs on the
  LAS X acquisition PC). The export is the `.lif` header re-encoded as UTF-8,
  so everything the `.lif` path does — full-precision phase/modulation/
  frequency, the region → channel binding table, Auto-match — works
  identically from the sidecar. This matters when the `.lif` is tens of
  gigabytes and stuck on the microscope computer: drag it onto the exe there,
  and carry home a file measured in kilobytes instead.

- **FLIM calibration read straight from a Leica `.lif`.** The Batch TCSPC
  dialog's calibration step now accepts a `.lif` wherever it accepted a CSV.
  Pick the file and the phase, modulation, and laser frequency come out of the
  header at full precision — no retyping, and no OCR pass over a screenshot of
  the LAS X Phasor Calibration dialog. This matters because LAS X *displays*
  rounded values: it shows `25.45°` and `0.9994` for numbers it stored as
  `25.45322087` and `1.000587231`, so a hand-copied CSV starts about four
  decimal places short. Because a `.lif` names its own regions and detectors
  rather than your `.h5` channel names, a binding table maps the two: press
  **Auto-match** to fill the rows that follow unambiguously, and use the
  dropdowns for the rest. Anything left unbound blocks the run and says which
  dataset and channel is short, rather than letting an uncalibrated channel
  through. Calibration CSVs work exactly as before.

- **See what Cellpose will see before you run it.** Tick **Preview saturation
  + blur** under Cellpose in the Segment tab and the active channel is shown
  exactly as it will reach Cellpose — after the **Saturation** clip and the
  **Blur (sigma)** smoothing set just above. The preview re-renders as you edit
  either value, follows the channel you select and the time slider on a
  time-lapse, and stands in for the raw channel (which comes back when you
  untick). This matters because the only way to judge a sigma before was to
  run Cellpose, wait, and guess whether a fragmented cell came from too little
  blur or from the flow threshold. Both values at 0 means Cellpose sees the
  raw channel, so nothing is drawn. The preview is display-only: it is never
  saved to the `.h5`, never listed as a channel, and never affects
  segmentation.

- **A diameter reference circle for Cellpose, in the Segment tab.** Tick
  **Show diameter reference circle** under Cellpose and a magenta disc appears
  at the bottom-left of the image, exactly as many pixels across as the
  **Diameter (px)** field says. Resize the field and the disc follows, so you
  can size the value against real cells instead of running Cellpose to find out
  it was wrong. This matters because the 300 px default is only right for the
  pixel size it was tuned against — datasets acquired at a different objective
  or camera binning need a different value, and there was previously no way to
  judge that by eye. Setting **Diameter (px)** to 0 means auto-detect, so no
  circle is drawn. The circle is display-only: it is never saved to the `.h5`,
  never affects segmentation, and cannot be dragged or reshaped.

- **Cellpose 4.2 models are now selectable.** The Segment tab, workflow dialog,
  and batch CLIs (`--cellpose-model`) offer the Cellpose 4.x built-ins —
  `cpsam_v2` (new default; improved CellposeSAM, fewer spurious masks in
  low-contrast regions), `cpsam` (original, for reproducing prior runs),
  `cpdino`, and `cpdino-vitb` (DINOv3 backbones). The 4.x wrapper now forwards
  the chosen model via `CellposeModel(pretrained_model=...)` (previously the
  model name was dropped on 4.x).

#### Changed

- **The workflow config dialog's Thresholding Rounds editor is now a card list.**
  Each round is a full-width card showing only the fields for its selected method
  (Grouped Otsu, or Adaptive Local Thresholding), with per-card move/remove
  controls — replacing the wide multi-method table where every method's columns
  showed at once. The **Adaptive σ-clipping (single-window)** method is no longer
  offered in the dialog; it remains available in the batch CLI
  (`percell4-batch-threshold`), and saved configs that use it still run.
- **Detection defaults changed — read this before comparing new results to old.**
  Three defaults moved as part of the interface cleanup below. Runs where you set
  the values explicitly are unaffected; runs left on the defaults will differ.
  - Adaptive Local Clipping no longer estimates the smallest particle from the
    image. Previously the default run measured it per dataset (Laplacian-of-
    Gaussian); now it always uses the Smallest Particle Diameter you supply.
  - That field's default is **2 px** (was 3 px), so the default detection
    neighbourhood is 6 px wide rather than sized from the estimate.
  - The default CNR classification mode is now **CNR threshold** at 8.0, which
    always splits the mask in two. The previous default (Discover) split only
    when it found a statistically significant gap.
- **Interface cleanup: controls that existed for development are gone.**
  - "Pixel Binning:" replaces "View bin (k):" in the Session window, and the
    Data panel now reads "Imported at binning: N | Pixel binning: N". Tooltips
    reworded to drop the internal `k` vocabulary.
  - Adaptive Local Clipping drops "Largest particle only (single pass)",
    "Auto-detect smallest (LoG)", "Coarse window / largest Ø (×)", and
    "Coarse-k false-pos. rate". The last two are pinned to the eye-validated
    constants they defaulted to, so removing them changes nothing on its own.
    "Smallest particle Ø" is now "Smallest Particle Diameter" and
    "Min particle size" is now "Min. Particle Area".
  - CNR Subpopulation Classification drops the "Discover (auto gap)" mode and
    the separate "Segment by CNR (interactive)" button. The remaining modes read
    "CNR threshold" and "Auto Two Groups", and a new "Interactive" mode launches
    the histogram segmenter from the same green "Classify Mask by CNR" button.
  - The pre-cleanup interface is preserved on the `dev-features` branch.

- Default segmentation model is now **`cpsam_v2`** (was `cpsam`) — re-running
  Cellpose yields improved, slightly different masks.
- Minimum Cellpose is now **4.2** (`cellpose>=4.2,<5`); the legacy 3.x code path
  and the `cyto3`/`cyto2`/`cyto`/`nuclei` model names are removed. **Run
  `pip install -U cellpose` (or reinstall the package) to pull 4.2.x.** A saved
  workflow config referencing a removed model falls back to `cpsam_v2`.

#### Fixed

- **Adaptive Local Clipping time-lapse tests were failing.** The commit that
  added the coarse fill-factor and FDR controls passed two new arguments the
  test doubles did not accept; removing those controls makes them match again.

### 2026-06 — Overlap-aware stitching, adaptive clipping, CNR

#### Added

- **Overlap-aware mosaic tile stitching.** Phase-correlation registration on the
  tile **overlap region** (matching the Fiji/ImageJ Grid-Collection approach),
  solved once on a reference channel and reused for every channel and the FLIM
  decay stream. Includes a grid-prior band constraint, ImageJ-style outlier
  rejection, a nominal-overlap **grid fallback** when a channel is too low-contrast
  to register, and **None / Linear Blending** overlap fusion (None is the
  measurement-correct default and is forced for FLIM datasets). (2026-06-24 – 06-25)
- **Adaptive Local Clipping (ALC) puncta detection.** GUI module for per-cell
  band-pass + z-score puncta detection, with auto-window methods and a two-pass
  auto-extraction mode that sizes the window to the smallest particle. (module
  2026-06-05; auto-extraction 2026-06-22 – 06-24)
- **CNR subpopulation classification** (discover / guided / forced) plus an
  **interactive CNR histogram segmenter** for splitting a feature mask into
  populations. (2026-06-23)
- **Time-lapse parity** for ALC auto-extraction and CNR classification — per-frame
  across the GUI panel, the workflow, and `percell4-batch-threshold`. (2026-06-25)
- **Iterative Otsu thresholding**, existing-mask reuse, and headless puncta
  thresholding via `percell4-batch-threshold --strategy {adaptive-clip,auto-extract}`.
  (2026-06-08 – 06-24)
- **Segment-tab Cellpose settings parity** so interactive and headless
  (`percell4-batch-cellpose-laptrack`) runs share the same controls. (2026-06-03)

#### Changed

- Faster load times for large datasets. (2026-06-06)

#### Fixed

- Channels renamed at import (Manual mode) are now valid stitch registration
  references. (2026-06-25)

#### Added

- **Time-lapse tracking + lineage** (powered by laptrack): import `_tN` series as a
  single multi-timepoint dataset, segment every frame, track each cell with one ID
  across time, link dividing cells parent → daughter, and view trajectories in a
  napari Tracks layer. (2026-05-21)
- **Workflow tracking + `percell4-batch-cellpose-laptrack`** headless
  compress → segment → track pipeline for overnight batch runs. (2026-05-22)
- **Phasor analysis depth:** GMM phasor segmentation, phasor cache + `.npz` I/O,
  "apply current phasor as mask", clear-within-ROI, FLIM filter options, and a
  FLIM-FRET analysis workflow. (2026-05-03 – 05-25)
- **Phasor-masks workflow** (single-cluster GMM ellipse → dual-threshold masks) with
  a shared ROI across a treatment cohort, plus the `percell4-batch-phasor-masks`
  CLI. (2026-05-27)
- **Dataset-wide spatial binning**, binned-TIFF export, batch phasor/wavelet
  compute, and batch image export. (2026-05-18 – 05-19)
- **Dilute-phase mask generation** — adaptive per-dataset round loop layered on
  grouped thresholding for phase-separated biology. (2026-05-18)
- **Session selection window** and channel override for Cellpose / FLIM. (2026-05-12 – 05-13)
- **`percell4-batch-rename` / `percell4-batch-delete`** resource CLIs; segmentation-QC
  recovery options. (2026-05-26)
- **Whole-field multichannel analyses** and per-particle multichannel CSV. (2026-05-28 – 05-29)
- **Pixel-size visibility + TIFF-metadata roundtrip**; README revamp with the
  step-by-step workflow protocol. (2026-05-21)
- **Windows-via-WSL** install path. (2026-05-14)

### 2026-04 — Workflows, batch compress, hexagonal architecture

  threshold QC → `/masks/<round>`, multiple rounds per workflow. (2026-04-03 – 04-04)
- **Batch TIFF compression** (`CompressDialog`, Auto/Manual modes, channel → layer
  assignment), the **Add Layer to Dataset** dialog, and the **Export Images** dialog.
  (2026-04-04 – 04-05)
- **TCSPC append + cross-format token matching** — append `.bin` decay onto an
  existing dataset by matching tokens. (2026-04-29)

- **Phasor UX:** active-mask histogram filter, Save Phasor PNG, `nipy_spectral`
  density colormap. (2026-04-30)

#### Changed

  ports seams; CLI adapter validates the seam). (2026-04-16)

#### Fixed
