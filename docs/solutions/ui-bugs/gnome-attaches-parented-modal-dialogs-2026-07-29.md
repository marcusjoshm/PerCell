# GNOME glues parented modal dialogs to their parent

## Problem

The researcher docks the launcher against the left or right edge of the
screen so the launcher and the napari viewer are usable side by side. Every
PerCell4 popup was a parented, application-modal `QDialog`. Opening one —
Compress TIFF Dataset, for example — put it partly off the screen with its
controls unreachable, and it could not be dragged back: dragging moved the
launcher instead.

## Root cause

Three conditions must **all** hold for mutter to attach a window to its
parent. Break any one and the popup is free.

1. The `attach-modal-dialogs` preference is on.
2. The window is a DIALOG type carrying `_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL`.
3. It has a `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` parent whose own type is NORMAL, DIALOG, or
   MODAL\_DIALOG.

Every PerCell4 popup satisfied all three. Once attached, mutter rewrites the
window's position on every constraint pass, which is why the application's
own `move()` was discarded.

Check the preference with:

```bash
gsettings get org.gnome.mutter attach-modal-dialogs
```

Note that mutter's own schema default is `false`, but GNOME Shell ships an
override setting it `true`, so reasoning from the schema default gives the
wrong answer. Whether every stock GNOME session has it on was not
established — the bug is confirmed on the reporter's machine.

## Solution

`src/percell4/gui/_dialog_utils.py` gained two helpers, both **no-ops off
Linux** and both required to run **before the first `show()`**:

- `detach_window(popup)` replaces the window-type nibble with `Qt.Tool`,
  which maps to `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY` and breaks condition 2.
- `center_on_screen(popup)` places the popup at the centre of its screen's
  work area, clamped so an oversized popup keeps its title bar reachable.

Popups built by a Qt static (`QMessageBox.warning`, `QInputDialog.getText`)
have no handle on which to set flags before showing, so they go through
`message_box()`, `progress_dialog()`, and `text_input()` in the same module.

### Why `Qt.Tool` and not `Qt.Window`

Both detach. `Qt.Window` also **deletes** `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`, losing the
stay-above-parent relationship and gaining a taskbar entry, and no call to
`QWindow.setTransientParent()` restores it — the gate in
`qxcbwindow.cpp`'s `isTransient()` is the window *type*, and `Qt::Window`
is not in its list. `Qt.Tool` is, so the transient parent survives.

Measured on GNOME/XWayland, launcher docked to the right edge, a 780×737
dialog on a 1920×1080 work area:

| Window type set | `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE` | `_NET_WM_STATE` | `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` | `move()` honoured |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| default (`Qt.Dialog`) | `DIALOG, NORMAL` | `MODAL, SKIP_TASKBAR` | parent | no |
| `Qt.Window` | `NORMAL` | `MODAL` | **absent** | yes |
| `Qt.Tool` | `UTILITY, NORMAL` | `MODAL, SKIP_PAGER, SKIP_TASKBAR` | parent | yes |

`Qt.Popup` and `Qt.ToolTip` are also in `isTransient()` but unusable:
`QXcbWindow::setWindowFlags` force-adds `X11BypassWindowManagerHint`, taking
the window out of mutter's management entirely.

### Condition 3 does most of the work

Because mutter checks the **parent's** type, converting a dialog frees every
popup parented to it, with no edit to those call sites. Verified with an
entirely unmodified modal child:

| Child | Parent's type | `move()` honoured |
|---|---|---|
| stock modal `QDialog` | NORMAL | no |
| stock modal `QDialog` | UTILITY | **yes** |

That is why roughly forty nested `QMessageBox` calls inside the converted
dialog classes are compliant precisely by being left alone, and why the
compliance test deliberately exempts them.

## What didn't work

**`setWindowFlag(Qt.Window, True)`.** A measured no-op on a `QDialog`:
`Qt.Dialog` is `0x3` and already contains the `Qt.Window` bit `0x1`, so the
flags come back byte-identical. The type nibble has to be *replaced*
(`(flags & ~Qt.WindowType_Mask) | Qt.Tool`). A test pins this explicitly so
a naive implementation cannot pass.

**Repositioning without detaching.** `move()` to screen centre on an
attached dialog is silently discarded — `constrain_modal_dialog` in mutter's
`constraints.c` rewrites x/y to the parent's centre and, unlike every other
constraint, has no priority guard, so it cannot be outvoted.

**Turning the preference off as the fix.** It stops the clipping but leaves
dialogs centred on the *launcher*: mutter's `place.c` centres any
dialog-type window over its transient parent at initial placement,
independent of the attach preference. Still a useful one-line workaround for
an affected user, but not a substitute.

**`setTransientParent()` after switching to `Qt.Window`.** Tried after
`show()`, after `create()`, and after `winId()`. The property is never
written, because the gate is the window type.

**Relaxing modality instead.** mutter latches its notion of modality when it
first manages a window and Qt never clears `_NET_WM_STATE_MODAL`, so runtime
modality flips leave the two out of sync. Modality was left untouched.

## Known limitation: vertical centring is approximate

Horizontal centring is exact. Vertical is biased low by half the title-bar
height (~18px under GNOME; measured frame margins were 37px top, 0px sides).
Before a window is mapped its `frameGeometry` equals its `geometry` — the
frame is the window manager's decision and is unmeasurable until show — and
centring must happen before show to set `Qt.WA_Moved`, which is what
suppresses `QDialog.adjustPosition`. Correcting it would require re-centring
after show, at the cost of a visible jump, for under 2% of a 1080px screen.

## Platform scope

Gated on `sys.platform`, deliberately **not** on `platformName()` or a
Wayland environment variable — the shape `opengl_platform.py` uses for a
different problem would be wrong here.

- **Not mutter-specific.** metacity (GNOME Flashback) and muffin (Cinnamon)
  carry the same `should_attach_to_parent` logic. KWin does not attach.
- **Not X11-specific.** mutter ≥47 implements `xdg-dialog-v1`, and QtWayland
  sends it as of Qt 6.8. Native Wayland is safe here only because Qt 5.15's
  QtWayland cannot mark a surface modal — a Qt-version artifact, not a
  platform guarantee. A `qtpy` codebase is one `QT_API` change from PyQt6.
- **macOS had the same defect for progress dialogs, now fixed.** See the
  section below.
- **Centring is X11/XWayland-only by construction.** xdg-shell gives clients
  no absolute-positioning request, so Qt ignores `move()` for top-levels on
  native Wayland regardless of modality.

## Prevention

`tests/test_gui/test_popup_window_compliance.py` asserts the invariant by
inspection across both GUI trees. **No automated tier in this repo can catch
a regression at runtime** — the offscreen platform has no window manager and
the GL tier runs without one either — so this inspection test is the only
mechanised guard, and the check below is manual.

### Manual repro

1. Confirm the preference: `gsettings get org.gnome.mutter attach-modal-dialogs`
   (set it `true` explicitly if reproducing on a machine where it is off).
2. Dock the launcher against the left or right screen edge.
3. Open a workflow dialog. It should appear centred on the screen, fully
   visible, and drag freely.
4. Inspect it: `xprop -id <winid> _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE _NET_WM_STATE WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`.
   Expect `UTILITY`, `MODAL` still present, and `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` **equal to
   the launcher's window id**. Compare the value, not merely the property's
   presence: a transient-type window with no transient parent still gets
   `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` pointing at the client leader.

## File pickers are affected too

`QFileDialog.get*` was initially assumed to resolve to the desktop portal
and therefore to be out of scope. **Measured on GNOME/XWayland, it does
not.** The static returns a Qt widget `QFileDialog` that meets all three
attach conditions and lands off-screen:

| | frame, launcher docked right | on screen |
|---|---|---|
| `QFileDialog.getOpenFileName` | `(1416, 274, 629, 452)` — right edge 2045 of 1920 | no |
| `_dialog_utils.open_file_name` | `(645, 332, 629, 452)` — dx 0 from centre | yes |

`testOption(DontUseNativeDialog)` is `False`, so this is Qt falling back to
its own widget dialog for want of a platform-theme plugin, not an explicit
choice. The repo sets neither `DontUseNativeDialog`,
`AA_DontUseNativeDialogs`, nor `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME`.

Four wrappers now cover the statics: `open_file_name`, `open_file_names`,
`save_file_name`, and `existing_directory`. **They deliberately do not set
`DontUseNativeDialog`.** Where a real native or portal chooser exists Qt
still uses it, the Qt widget is never mapped, and the helpers apply to
nothing — inert rather than a regression. Where Qt falls back to its own
widget dialog, the helpers make it freestanding.

Twelve call sites were converted. The other twenty-nine live inside the
converted dialog classes, parented to a UTILITY window, and are already
free by the parent-type condition above.

## macOS: the same symptom, a different mechanism

`QCocoaWindow::setVisible` turns any **parented** window whose modality is
`Qt::WindowModal` into a native `NSWindow` sheet -- glued to the parent's
title bar and unmovable. All nine progress dialogs were exactly that case.

**The `Qt.Tool` fix does not help here.** Cocoa keys on modality plus a
native parent, not on the window type, so the escape hatch that works under
mutter does nothing. The only levers are modality and the parent.

That collides with a Qt detail worth knowing: **`QProgressDialog.setValue()`
pumps the event loop only when `isModal()`.** A run loop that polls
`wasCanceled()` without calling `processEvents()` itself therefore depends on
modality for its own cancellation -- make it non-modal and the bar stops
repainting and Cancel becomes permanently unreachable, silently.

So the nine split in two, by whether the loop pumps events itself:

| Run loop | Modality | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Phasor masks, per-particle multichannel, per-particle donut, dilute-from-mask, whole-field intensity | `Qt.NonModal` everywhere | each calls `processEvents()` in its own loop and disables its form controls for the duration, so modality bought nothing |
| Segmentation QC re-run | `Qt.NonModal` everywhere | runs on a `Worker` thread and never polls `wasCanceled()` |
| Compress, batch TCSPC, FLIM-FRET | `blocking_progress_modality()` | poll `wasCanceled()` with no `processEvents()` of their own -- they need the modal pump |

`blocking_progress_modality()` returns `Qt.ApplicationModal` on macOS and
`Qt.WindowModal` elsewhere. `ApplicationModal` routes through
`beginModalSession` rather than `beginSheet`, so the dialog is a free-floating
window while `isModal()` stays true and the pump survives. Blocking the whole
application rather than just the parent costs nothing for these three: each is
a synchronous loop on the GUI thread that already monopolises it.

The launcher's dataset-load dialog was already `ApplicationModal` and needed
no change.

`tests/test_gui/test_progress_dialog_modality.py` pins the split by
inspection, in both directions -- a pump-dependent loop going non-modal and a
self-pumping loop going window-modal are both reported. It also asserts the
split is not degenerate, so a refactor cannot collapse every dialog into one
bucket and leave the other assertion vacuous.

**Confirmed on macOS, 2026-07-30.** The progress windows float free rather
than hanging from their parent's title bar, and Cancel still works on the
three that keep modality. That second half was the real risk: a wrong split
here fails silently -- the dialog still appears, it just never responds to
Cancel -- so the inspection test above is the guard, and this is the
observation behind it. The Cocoa reasoning is no longer only reasoning.

## The conversion has a cost the diff does not show

Moving call sites onto the wrappers silently invalidated every test that had
patched the Qt static — 19 patch points across three test files in `edef8b1`,
plus two more found later. Two of them *hung* the suite rather than failing it,
and one asserted against an empty list while still reporting green. Budget for
that sweep when converting further call sites:
[`../conventions/retarget-test-patches-when-converting-call-sites.md`](../conventions/retarget-test-patches-when-converting-call-sites.md).
