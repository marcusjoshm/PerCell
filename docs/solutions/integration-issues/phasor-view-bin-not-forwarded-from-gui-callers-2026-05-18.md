# View bin parameter accepted by use cases but not forwarded by GUI callers

## Problem

After a 15-unit feature (U0–U14) added dataset-wide spatial binning, toggling
the SessionWindow view-bin QSpinBox re-binned napari image layers correctly
but the phasor plot did not update — it kept rendering native-shape `(g, s)`
arrays. The receiver (`LoadCachedPhasor` and four other FLIM use cases) had
been wired to accept a `view_bin` kwarg, and the cache invalidation on
`Event.ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED` correctly cleared 11 ndarray caches, but every
GUI caller forgot to pass `session.active_bin`, so each post-invalidation
reload defaulted to `view_bin=1` and re-hydrated from the same native-shape
arrays.

## Symptoms

- User toggles the view-bin SpinBox from k=1 → k=2 → k=3 in SessionWindow.
- Napari image layers (intensity, segmentation, masks) re-render at the
  binned shape — correct.
- The phasor plot's histogram and ROIs do not change shape at all — looks
  identical regardless of bin.
- No error, no console warning. The 11 ndarray caches were dutifully
  cleared on `ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED` and dutifully refilled with the same
  content from disk.
- Affects: phasor histogram on cache reload, freshly computed
  phasor/wavelet/lifetime, GMM input arrays.

## What Didn't Work

U14 made two changes that each looked sufficient in isolation but together
still produced unchanged output:

1. **Receiver-side kwarg.** `ComputePhasor`, `ApplyWavelet`,
   `ComputeLifetime`, `RunPhasorGMM` were each given `view_bin: int = 1`.
   The kwarg existed at the use-case boundary; no caller passed it. **A
   receiver-side parameter with no sender wiring is dead code that lies
   about being live.**

2. **Cache invalidation on `ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED`.**
   `PhasorPlotWindow._invalidate_for_bin_change` enumerated and cleared
   11 ndarray caches (`_g_map`, `_g_map_unfiltered`, `_s_map`,
   `_s_map_unfiltered`, `_intensity`, `_labels`, `_labels_flat`,
   `_active_mask_array`, `_active_mask_flat`, `_cleared_mask`, per-ROI
   `cached_mask`). The invalidation fired correctly. But the immediate
   re-hydration path — `LoadCachedPhasor.execute` triggered by
   `_try_auto_load_cached` — had never been given a `view_bin` parameter
   at all. Every read defaulted to k=1 and refilled the just-cleared
   caches with the same native-shape arrays.

3. **Existing tests.** U14 verified separately that (a) the four use
   cases accepted `view_bin` and (b) the PhasorPlot invalidation
   chokepoint cleared the right caches. Both passed. Nothing exercised
   the full chain: bin toggle → invalidate → reload → display. The
   integration gap had zero coverage.

## Solution

Close the wiring at every caller and add the missing kwarg to the read
path.

**1. `LoadCachedPhasor.execute` — add `view_bin` to the read path itself.**

Before (`src/percell4/application/use_cases/load_cached_phasor.py`):

```python
def execute(self, channel: str) -> CachedPhasorResult:
    handle = self._session.dataset
    if handle is None:
        raise NoDatasetError("No dataset loaded")
    g_map = self._repo.read_array(handle, f"phasor/{channel}/g")
    s_map = self._repo.read_array(handle, f"phasor/{channel}/s")
    # ... g_filtered, s_filtered, decay reads, all without view_bin
```

After:

```python
def execute(self, channel: str, view_bin: int = 1) -> CachedPhasorResult:
    handle = self._session.dataset
    if handle is None:
        raise NoDatasetError("No dataset loaded")
    g_map = self._repo.read_array(
        handle, f"phasor/{channel}/g", view_bin=view_bin
    )
    s_map = self._repo.read_array(
        handle, f"phasor/{channel}/s", view_bin=view_bin
    )
    # ... all 5 reads (g, s, g_filtered, s_filtered, decay/<ch>) forward view_bin
```

The store dispatches per path: `mean_bin_2d` for intensive `g/s`
(magnitudes preserved at any k), `sum_bin_decay` for the decay tensor
(T axis preserved).

**2. Representative GUI caller — `_on_compute_phasor` in
`src/percell4/interfaces/gui/task_panels/flim_panel.py:289`.**

Before:

```python
repo = self._get_repo()
cached = LoadCachedPhasor(repo, self.data_model.session).execute(
    active_channel,
)
```

After:

```python
repo = self._get_repo()
# Session view bin propagates through the cache load so cached g/s
# and decay-derived intensity arrive at the binned shape the phasor
# plot expects to display.
active_bin = self.data_model.session.active_bin
cached = LoadCachedPhasor(repo, self.data_model.session).execute(
    active_channel, view_bin=active_bin,
)
```

Same pattern applied at 8 caller-sites total: `flim_panel.py` lines 289
(`LoadCachedPhasor` in compute_phasor handler), 326 (`ComputePhasor.execute`),
349 (decay read for histogram weights), 396 (`LoadCachedPhasor` in
apply_wavelet handler), 435 (`ApplyWavelet.execute`), 505
(`ComputeLifetime.execute`), 681 (`RunPhasorGMM` via Worker kwargs); plus
`phasor_plot.py:2142` (`LoadCachedPhasor` in `_try_auto_load_cached`).

**3. Capture-at-construction for the GMM worker
(`flim_panel.py:660-704`).**

The GMM runs on a `QThread` worker. If the user toggles the bin
mid-flight, naive `session.active_bin` reads inside the worker would
resolve to a different bin than the one current when GMM started — the
result would not match the user's pre-click intent. Capture in the
kwargs dict before constructing the worker:

```python
kwargs = dict(
    channel=active_channel,
    # ... other params ...
    # Capture session.active_bin at worker-construction (race-safe
    # per the U12 capture pattern) so a mid-flight bin toggle cannot
    # alter the resolution of an in-flight GMM result.
    view_bin=self.data_model.session.active_bin,
)
# ...
self._gmm_worker = Worker(uc.execute, **kwargs)
self._gmm_worker.start()
```

The capture happens on the GUI thread before `Worker(...)` exists; the
worker thread reads its kwarg snapshot, not live session state.

**4. Regression tests in
`tests/test_application/test_load_cached_phasor.py`.** A recording fake
repo captures `(path, view_bin)` per call:

```python
class _RecordingRepo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.arrays: dict[str, np.ndarray] = {}
        self.reads: list[tuple[str, int]] = []

    def read_array(self, handle, path, view_bin=1):
        self.reads.append((path, view_bin))
        if path not in self.arrays:
            raise KeyError(path)
        return self.arrays[path]


def test_load_cached_phasor_forwards_view_bin_to_every_read(session):
    repo = _RecordingRepo()
    repo.arrays["phasor/ch0/g"] = np.zeros((8, 8), dtype=np.float32)
    # ... s, g_filtered, s_filtered, decay/ch0 ...

    LoadCachedPhasor(repo, session).execute("ch0", view_bin=3)

    for path, vb in repo.reads:
        assert vb == 3, f"read of {path} used view_bin={vb}, expected 3"


def test_load_cached_phasor_default_view_bin_is_one(session):
    # Backward-compat: omitting view_bin reads at k=1.
    LoadCachedPhasor(repo, session).execute("ch0")
    assert all(vb == 1 for _, vb in repo.reads)
```

Pre-fix the first test fails at the use-case signature (the `view_bin`
kwarg did not exist). Post-fix it pins both that every read forwards
`view_bin` and that the default is `1`.

## Why This Works

The root cause is a **wiring-not-logic** failure: the receiver knew how
to bin, the invalidator knew when to clear, but nothing ever told the
read path which bin to use. Once `LoadCachedPhasor.execute` accepts
`view_bin` and forwards it to its five `repo.read_array(...)` calls,
and once every caller threads `session.active_bin` into its use-case
invocation, the chain reconnects:

1. User toggles the SpinBox → `Session` emits `ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED`.
2. `PhasorPlotWindow._invalidate_for_bin_change` clears the 11 ndarray
   caches.
3. `_try_auto_load_cached` calls
   `LoadCachedPhasor(..., view_bin=session.active_bin)`.
4. The store dispatches each read through its per-rule downsampler
   (`mean_bin_2d` for `g/s`, `sum_bin_decay` for `decay/<ch>`).
5. The phasor plot renders the binned arrays.

Pre-fix, step 3 silently dropped the bin and step 4 returned native-shape
arrays; the cache was cleared and refilled with the same content.

The GMM worker fix is a slightly different concern — it is about *when*
the bin is captured, not *whether*. Reading `session.active_bin` inside
a worker thread is a race because the GUI thread can mutate session
state during the worker's run. Capturing into the kwargs dict on the
GUI thread before `Worker(...)` is constructed gives the worker an
immutable snapshot of "the bin the user intended when they clicked Run."

## Prevention

**Pattern: optional kwarg + every caller.** When you add an optional
kwarg to a use case (or any function called from many sites), do not
stop at the signature. Immediately:

1. Grep for every call site:
   `rg 'LoadCachedPhasor\(.*\)\.execute\('` or the moral equivalent.
2. For each site, identify which context owns the value (here:
   `session.active_bin`).
3. Pass it explicitly. Defaulting silently to "the safe value" is the
   failure mode — the safe default is what hid the bug for an entire
   15-unit plan.

A receiver-side kwarg with no sender wiring is dead code that lies about
being live.

**Test pattern: walk the full chain end-to-end.** U14's tests verified
two ends of the chain in isolation (use case accepts kwarg, cache clears
on event). Neither caught the broken middle. For state-propagation
features, write at least one integration test that exercises:

```
state change -> invalidation -> reload -> observable display contents
```

For this codebase that means: emit the session event, assert the caches
cleared, then assert the reload populated them with binned-shape arrays
(not just any arrays).

**Recording-mock pattern.** A fake repo that records `(path, kwarg, ...)`
per call is the cheapest way to verify wiring at the use-case layer
without spinning up Qt:

```python
class _RecordingRepo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reads: list[tuple[str, int]] = []

    def read_array(self, handle, path, view_bin=1):
        self.reads.append((path, view_bin))
        return self.arrays[path]
```

You do not need to assert on array contents — just assert that the
wiring delivered the parameter to every read. Cheap, fast, catches the
exact class of bug U14 had.

**Capture-at-construction for worker race safety.** Whenever a
`Worker(...)` wraps a use case that reads from `Session`, capture every
session-derived value into the kwargs dict on the GUI thread **before**
the worker is constructed. Never read `session.foo` inside the worker.
This is the U12 pattern (Cellpose) and now the same pattern for the GMM
worker — make it a rule across the codebase. A mid-flight toggle must
not be able to retroactively change the meaning of an in-flight result.

**User-facing surface parity (added 2026-05-19).** The forward-at-every-
caller rule above governs the *plumbing* — what flows between use case
and call site. A separate but complementary rule governs the *user-
facing surface* when an Action tool (export, save, copy, …) is given an
*opt-in* to honor a live GUI lens (`view_bin`, contrast, color map,
…) rather than implicitly inheriting it. The pattern has four parts.

This came up in `feat: Optional view-bin export for TIFFs (GUI + CLI)`
(2026-05-19 — commits `387e19b`, `2278740`, `214e6f4`, `c32b7fd`,
merged in `28301f8`) when the Export Images dialog and the
`percell4-batch-export` CLI both gained a `--view-bin` opt-in. The
forwarding rule alone wasn't enough — there were upstream UX questions
the existing learning didn't answer.

1. **Default = the established contract.** Existing callers and scripts
   must keep working with zero change. For TIFF exports, the contract
   is "exports are an archive, at native resolution". The opt-in lands
   with the no-op value as default (`view_bin: int = 1` on
   `ExportRequest`). The R7 zero-regression invariant in the feature
   plan pinned this — all 17 pre-existing batch-export tests and 15
   pre-existing CLI tests passed unchanged.

2. **Opt-in via single toggle that names the live source.**
   - GUI: a `QCheckBox` whose label includes the live value, e.g.
     `"Apply current view bin (k=4) to exports"`. The k=N is rendered
     from the session at the time the dialog draws, refreshed on
     `Event.ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED`.
   - CLI: a positive-int flag with an explicit default, e.g.
     `--view-bin N` (default `1`), with a validator that rejects N<1.

   Naming the live source in the label avoids "use whatever the system
   feels like" surprises.

3. **Live read at action-time, not at construct-time.** The dialog's
   accessor reads `session.active_bin` at the moment the launcher calls
   it (post-Accept), not when the dialog opens:

   ```python
   def selected_view_bin(self) -> int:
       if not self._view_bin_check.isChecked():
           return 1
       return int(self._session.active_bin)
   ```

   While the dialog is open, the user can change the SessionWindow
   SpinBox and the label updates immediately via
   `Event.ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED`. The final export honors whatever value
   is current at click-time. Subscribe on construct; unsubscribe in
   `accept()`, `reject()`, AND `closeEvent()` via a `_bin_unsubscribe`
   sentinel — idempotent teardown is non-negotiable here, same
   discipline as the napari-modal-tool-overlay pattern.

4. **CLI surface parity.** Whatever the GUI exposes as a checkbox, the
   CLI exposes as a flag with the same default and same validator
   semantics. A GUI-only toggle creates a two-tier user base
   (interactive vs scripted); the CLI flag closes that gap and means
   the use-case layer has exactly one knob both surfaces drive.

   ```python
   def _positive_int(raw: str) -> int:
       value = int(raw)
       if value < 1:
           raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(f"must be >= 1, got {value}")
       return value

   parser.add_argument(
       "--view-bin", type=_positive_int, default=1, metavar="N", ...,
   )
   ```

**Out-of-scope decisions deliberately rejected (worth recording):**

- **No filename suffix encoding.** Output filenames stay
  `<stem>_<layer>.tif` regardless of bin. Encoding `_binN` would make
  downstream scripts fragile against the toggle's presence/absence —
  the user knowingly opts in per export run.
- **Disabled, not hidden, at the no-op state.** When `active_bin == 1`
  the checkbox is `setEnabled(False)` with the label still showing
  `"(k=1) — no effect at native"`. Hiding it would let users miss that
  the feature exists; disabling teaches the affordance.

**Canonical callsites for the user-facing pattern** (added with this
extension; the forward-at-every-caller examples above remain the
canonical reference for the underlying wiring rule):

- `src/percell4/application/use_cases/export_images.py`
  (`ExportRequest.view_bin: int = 1` field; `ExportImages.execute`
  forwards to all three `repo.read_*` calls).
- `src/percell4/application/use_cases/batch_export_images.py`
  (orchestrator `view_bin` kwarg threaded into `ExportRequest`).
- `src/percell4/interfaces/cli/batch_export.py` (`--view-bin N` flag
  with `_positive_int` validator).
- `src/percell4/gui/export_images_dialog.py` (`QCheckBox` with live
  ACTIVE_BIN_CHANGED subscription, `selected_view_bin()` accessor).
- `src/percell4/interfaces/gui/main_window.py:1407-1450`
  (`_on_export_images` passes `session=self.data_model.session`,
  reads `dlg.selected_view_bin()`, threads into `ExportRequest`,
  status-bar message includes "at k=N" when `view_bin > 1`).

When to apply: adding a user-facing option to an **Action** tool
(per `gui-action-contract-exhaustiveness.md`'s Selector/Creator/Action
taxonomy) that should optionally honor a live GUI lens
(`active_bin`, contrast, color map, blend mode, …). The lens must be
session-owned with an `Event.*_CHANGED` event the dialog can subscribe
to. There must be an established "archive" or "native" default to
preserve. The tool already has, or should have, a CLI surface.

Do NOT apply when the lens IS the data (e.g. segmentation choice — a
Selector concern, not opt-in), or when there is no native default to
preserve (then the lens should just always apply).
