"""Dataset eligibility / pre-screening for the FLIM-FRET analysis workflow.

This module is Qt-free and importable without a running ``QApplication``. It
provides two surfaces:

- :func:`discover_flim_fret_candidates` — scan a folder for ``.h5`` files and
  classify each as eligible or excluded, with human-readable reasons.
- :func:`validate_pair_layers` — re-validate a configured pair against the
  live ``.h5`` files at run time (called from the orchestrator at the top of
  per-pair compute).

The qualification rule mirrors the user-chosen contract: a dataset is eligible
only if it has at least one ``/masks/<name>`` ending in ``_mask``, one ending
in ``_phasor``, and one channel name ending in ``_lifetime`` under
``/intensity``. Single-cell mode additionally requires at least one
``/labels/<name>``. Time-lapse ``/intensity`` (4D ``(T, C, H, W)``) is
explicitly out of scope and rejected at discovery.
