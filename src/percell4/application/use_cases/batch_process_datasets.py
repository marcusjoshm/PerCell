"""Use case: headless batch compress → segment-all-timepoints → track.

Built for overnight processing of large multi-timepoint experiments: per
dataset it imports the TIFF series to an ``.h5``, segments every timepoint,
and (when the dataset is time-lapse) tracks cells. No Qt/napari — uses the
same composition root as ``run_pipeline`` (repo + NullViewerAdapter +
Session). Robust to per-dataset failures: one bad dataset is recorded and the
batch continues.

    A spec's ``source_dir`` may be a TIFF directory (imported) or an
    already-compressed ``.h5`` (the compress/import step is skipped — see
    :class:`DatasetSpec`). ``.h5`` sources are segmented in place, or copied
    to ``output_h5`` first when that differs from the source.

    ``seg_channel`` selects the segmentation channel (defaults to the first);
    it is resolved against the *effective* channel names, i.e. after any
    ``channel_names`` override is applied.

    ``channel_names`` optionally **overrides** the imported channel names
    (e.g. friendly ``["DAPI", "GFP"]`` in place of the importer's
    ``ch00``/``ch01``). It must have one name per imported channel — the
    override is a pure relabel that preserves channel order (channel *i*
    keeps its pixels). Applied uniformly to every dataset in the batch; a
    count mismatch is recorded as that dataset's failure and the batch
    continues.

    ``seg_name`` optionally sets the segmentation layer name (passed to
    ``SegmentCells.finalize``); defaults to the historical
    ``cellpose_<n_cells>``. A name that collides with an existing channel or
    segmentation in the flat HDF5 namespace is rejected (such a collision
    crashes the GUI on later load).

    ``settings`` is the full :class:`CellposeSettings` (model, diameter, GPU,
    flow/cellprob thresholds, min size, saturation %, blur sigma); defaults to
    ``CellposeSettings()`` when not given. The per-frame saturation LUT and
    Gaussian blur are applied to an in-memory copy of the segmentation channel
    before inference — mirroring the GUI Segment panel and
    ``workflows.phases.segment_one``; the on-disk ``/intensity`` is never
    modified. ``remove_edge_cells`` / ``edge_margin`` control border-cell
    removal in post-processing.

    ``skip_segmentation`` runs tracking only on an **existing** segmentation
    layer (no Cellpose): ``seg_name`` then names the existing ``(T, H, W)``
    segmentation to track and is required. Useful for re-tracking an already
    segmented ``.h5`` with different laptrack behavior, or after hand-editing
    raw masks. Only meaningful for a time-lapse dataset with ``track=True``.

    ``track`` runs tracking for time-lapse datasets (``n_timepoints > 1``).
    ``segmenter`` / ``tracker`` may be injected for testing; otherwise the
    real Cellpose / laptrack adapters are constructed lazily. A per-dataset
    failure is recorded on the report and never aborts the batch.
    ``progress_callback(done, total, message)`` fires after each dataset.
    Granular per-frame / timing detail is emitted via this module's logger at
    DEBUG level (surfaced by the CLI's ``--verbose``).

    ``projection`` is the z-projection segmentation reads (``None``: max,
    else the dataset's only projection). A dataset that cannot resolve it
    fails with the reason; the batch continues.
