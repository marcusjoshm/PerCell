"""Use case: load cached phasor + wavelet results from the dataset.

Single read path consumed by both the FlimPanel button handlers
(_on_compute_phasor / _on_apply_wavelet) and the Phasor window's
auto-load on showEvent / active-channel switch. Eliminates duplicate
read code; keeps cache semantics in one tested place.

Trusts the upstream cache-invalidation chain — TCSPC re-import clears
/phasor/<ch> via add_decay_to_dataset; recompute_phasor deletes stale
g_filtered/s_filtered/lifetime_filtered. A non-empty /phasor/<ch> is,
by invariant, aligned with the current /decay/<ch>. Documented in
docs/solutions/logic-errors/flim-phasor-cross-layer-alignment-2026-04-29.md.

Asymmetric cache (g present, s missing) cannot occur under normal
operation but is defended against — a missing s after g succeeded
raises NoCachedPhasorError so callers fall through to compute rather
than surfacing a stack trace.

class CachedPhasorResult:
    """Result of reading cached phasor data for one channel.

    Fields are scoped to what the two consumers (FlimPanel buttons,
    PhasorPlot auto-load) actually use. ``cached_filter_level`` is the
    DTCWT level ApplyWavelet stamped on ``g_filtered``, surfaced via the
    repo port's ``read_array_attrs`` so the Apply-Wavelet handler can
    recompute when the user picks a different level instead of serving a
    stale cache. It is ``None`` when there is no filtered cache, when the
    attr is absent (pre-attr files), or when the repo does not implement
    ``read_array_attrs`` (test fakes). ``cached_harmonic`` is the Fourier
    harmonic ComputePhasor stamped on the raw ``g`` array, surfaced the
    same way so the Compute-Phasor handler can recompute when the user
    picks a different harmonic instead of serving a stale cache computed
    at another harmonic. It is ``None`` when the attr is absent (pre-attr
    files) or the repo lacks ``read_array_attrs`` (test fakes).
    ``cached_wavelet_params`` is the algorithm-variant dict ApplyWavelet
    stamped as the ``wavelet_params`` JSON attr (see
    :class:`~percell4.domain.flim.wavelet_filter.WaveletParams`); ``None``
    when absent — files written before the variant existed were computed
    by the reference script's Anscombe pair, which the Apply-Wavelet
    handler treats as no longer matching any preset (so it recomputes).
    Remaining writer attrs (flim_frequency_mhz) stay unsurfaced — no
    consumer needs them.
