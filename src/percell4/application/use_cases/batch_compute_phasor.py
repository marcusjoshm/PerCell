"""Use case: batch compute phasor + apply wavelet across many ``.h5`` datasets.

Thin orchestration around :class:`ComputePhasor` and :class:`ApplyWavelet`.
Per dataset, the orchestrator:

1. Opens the ``.h5`` via :class:`Hdf5DatasetRepository` and builds a fresh
   :class:`Session` with the resulting handle.
2. Enumerates channels under ``/decay/*`` via ``store.list_groups("decay")``.
3. For each channel, runs two pre-flight skip checks:
   - **Existing phasor:** ``/phasor/<ch>/g`` present and ``overwrite=False``
     → skip with a structured reason.
   - **Missing calibration:** any of ``flim_cal_phase_<ch>``,
     ``flim_cal_mod_<ch>``, ``flim_frequency_mhz`` absent from
     ``/metadata`` → skip with a structured reason.
4. Otherwise calls
   :meth:`ComputePhasor.execute` (writes ``/phasor/<ch>/g`` and ``/s``)
   then :meth:`ApplyWavelet.execute` (writes ``g_filtered``,
   ``s_filtered``, ``lifetime_filtered``).
5. Collects per-channel results into a :class:`BatchPhasorItemResult`,
   classifies the dataset's overall status, fires the
   ``progress_callback`` (if provided), and continues.

``view_bin=1`` is passed explicitly at every ``ComputePhasor.execute``
and ``ApplyWavelet.execute`` call site -- batch runs are headless and
never see a session-level view bin, but the explicit kwarg makes the
orchestrator's posture grep-visible (per
``docs/solutions/integration-issues/phasor-view-bin-not-forwarded-from-gui-callers-2026-05-18.md``).

The orchestrator is pure-Python and Session-free at the boundary -- it
constructs a Session per dataset internally but never exposes Qt or
``CellDataModel``. Per-channel failures isolate; per-dataset failures
isolate; the loop continues. The returned :class:`BatchPhasorReport`
carries truthful partial state.
