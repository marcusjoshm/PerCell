"""Use case: create a "whole_field" segmentation across .h5 datasets.

For each input ``.h5``, writes ``/labels/whole_field`` — a 2D int32
array shaped to the dataset's native (H, W), with every pixel = 1.
Useful as a baseline gating layer for whole-field measurements (or
as a starting point before per-cell Cellpose runs).

Shape is inferred from ``/metadata.native_shape`` when present;
otherwise from the first ``/decay/<channel>`` group's shape. An empty
dataset with neither metadata nor decay can't be shaped — its item
ends ``failed`` with a clear error.

Pre-existing ``/labels/whole_field`` is silently overwritten — every
run rewrites all-ones at the current native shape. ``--dry-run``
classifies as a live run would but does not mutate any file.

Reuses :class:`BatchOperationItemResult` / :class:`BatchOperationReport`
from :mod:`batch_rename_resource` so all sibling CLIs share output
helpers and exit-code semantics.
