"""Concrete runner for the single-cell thresholding workflow.

Subclasses :class:`BaseWorkflowRunner` and implements
``_phase_generator`` as a sequence of UNATTENDED :class:`PhaseRequest`
objects that drive the pure helpers in
:mod:`percell4.workflows.phases`:

    Phase 0 — compress(each ``tiff_pending`` entry)
    Phase 1 — segment(every dataset)
    For each configured thresholding round:
        Phase 3 — threshold_compute(every dataset)
        Phase 4 — apply_threshold_headless(every dataset)
    Phase 7 — measure(every dataset) → write staging parquet
    Phase 8 — export_run(aggregate → measurements.parquet + CSVs)

Phase 4 of the implementation plan uses the headless thresholding path
for every round. When Phase 5 lands, Phase 1 will yield an INTERACTIVE
request for the segmentation QC dialog in addition to the unattended
segment handler; when Phase 6 lands, the per-round "apply" phase will
be replaced by an INTERACTIVE threshold-QC queue. The runner itself
does not need to change shape for those phases — only the
``_phase_generator`` body does.

All failures are routed through :func:`phases.record_failure`, which
appends a :class:`FailureRecord` to the run metadata. Subsequent phases
skip datasets that have been marked failed; the export step rolls the
failures into ``run_config.json``. A misbehaving dataset never crashes
the run.
