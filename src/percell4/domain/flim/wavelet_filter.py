"""DTCWT-based wavelet filtering for FLIM phasor data.

Faithful match to the reference ``ComplexWaveletFilter.py`` (LeeLabBCM):
Anscombe → DTCWT (``biort='Legall'``, ``qshift='qshift_a'``) → inter-scale
Wiener-like shrinkage → inverse DTCWT → inverse Anscombe, followed by the
reference's phasor recovery (divide by filtered intensity, ``nan_to_num``,
threshold by *unfiltered* intensity, clip to ``[-0.1, 1.1]``). The math is
vectorized with numpy/scipy for ~100x speedup over the reference's nested
Python loops, but produces output identical to the reference to float
precision (verified against ``dataset_CWFlevels=9.npz``: G ~1e-8, S ~1e-5).

Three details are load-bearing for that identity and must not drift from
the reference: the Anscombe clamp order (``2√(max(data,0)+3/8)``), the
*unclamped* inverse Anscombe (clamping is deferred to ``nan_to_num`` +
clip in :func:`denoise_phasor`), and the ``Legall`` biorthogonal basis.

Requires the optional ``dtcwt`` package: ``pip install dtcwt>=0.14.0``
