"""Intensity-array → display-layer splitting.

A leading time axis ``(T, ...)`` and a leading channel axis ``(C, H, W)``
are indistinguishable from shape alone, so the split is driven by the
dataset's ``n_timepoints`` metadata. Display code keeps the time axis so
napari builds a single dims slider; compute code asks for one timepoint
frame and splits that into 2D per-channel planes.

Pure numpy — no h5py, Qt, or napari.
