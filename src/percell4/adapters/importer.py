    The reader streams every raw plane once, z innermost. Each plane goes

    of the kept projections; nothing larger than one plane per projection is
    held in memory. ``storage`` defaults to one projection by ``z_method``,
    the import made before storage choices existed.

    Projections are named arrays in the store's existing layouts: ``(H, W)``,
    ``(C, H, W)``, ``(T, H, W)`` or ``(T, C, H, W)`` float32. They are
    projected at full resolution and then binned by ``creation_bin``; z-series
    planes are binned one by one. Channel tokens are the file's channel
    indices, named through ``channel_display_name``.

    The file is written to a temporary path beside ``output_h5`` and moved
    into place only when complete, so cancel or failure leaves no dataset
    file. An existing output is replaced as a whole. ``import_dataset`` is
    not involved; token imports are unchanged.

    """Stream-write a TCSPC decay channel to ``/decay/<channel_name>`` in an
    .h5 file, tile by tile.

    Single source of truth for `.bin` decay writes — used by both the
    initial-import (compress) flow and the append-via-add-layer flow so
    that identical inputs (TileConfig + bin_dims + tile_bins) produce
    byte-identical output. Mirrors what compress's importer used to do
    inline.

    Existing data at ``/decay/<channel_name>`` is overwritten — caller is
    responsible for any conflict-checking (e.g.,
    ``DatasetStore.append_decay_layers`` raises ``LayerAlreadyExists`` for
    that, but this helper sits below that check by design — it's the
    write primitive).

    ``spatial_bin`` sums non-overlapping k×k blocks per tile after read,
    before placement (T-axis untouched). Use to match a higher-resolution
    TCSPC source to a downsampled TIFF /intensity — e.g., k=3 reduces a
    512×512 tile to 170×170, dropping the 2 residual pixels per axis.
    Sum (not mean) preserves Poisson photon counts. ``tile_h``, ``tile_w``,
    ``out_h`` and ``out_w`` are the POST-binning dimensions.

    ``pixel_offsets`` selects the registered (overlap-aware) placement path.
    When ``None`` (default), tiles land on the fixed edge-to-edge grid
    (``y0 = row·tile_h``, ``x0 = col·tile_w``) and the output is
    byte-identical to the legacy grid path. When provided, it maps each
    0-based tile index to an absolute post-bin ``(y0, x0)`` top-left corner;
    the canvas comes from :func:`canvas_from_offsets` (never recomputed
    inline) and tiles are placed with plain overwrite. Placement priority is
    pinned **ascending tile index** (highest index wins overlaps), with any
    indices in ``disconnected`` placed **first** (lowest priority) so an
    untrusted tile never overwrites a registered neighbour — mirroring
    ``assemble_tiles_with_offsets`` so intensity and decay resolve every
    overlap pixel to the same tile. ``disconnected`` is ignored on the grid
    path.

    ``tile_rotate_k`` / ``tile_flip_axis`` apply the LASX orientation fix PER
    TILE (rotate k·90° CCW then flip), before placement — used by the registered
    append so each ``.bin`` tile matches its ``/intensity`` counterpart at the
    persisted offset and the mosaic lands at ``native_shape`` (a whole-image
    rotate would transpose a registered overlap mosaic off ``native_shape``).
    ``tile_h``/``tile_w`` are the POST-rotation tile dimensions; the rotated tile
    must match them. Defaults ``0``/``None`` (no-op) on the grid path, which
    instead whole-image-rotates after stitching.

    ``n_acq`` / ``timepoint`` drive the time-lapse layout. With ``n_acq == 1``
    (default) the output is a 3-D ``(out_h, out_w, n_bins)`` decay, byte-identical
    to the legacy write. With ``n_acq > 1`` the decay is 4-D
    ``(n_acq, out_h, out_w, n_bins)`` (``dims=["Tacq","H","W","T"]``, ``T_acq``
    chunked to 1): the dataset is allocated once on ``timepoint == 0`` (and the
    stale ``/phasor`` is invalidated then) and each frame is written in place at
    the leading ``[timepoint]`` index. Call once per acquisition timepoint with
    the SAME geometry every frame so ``/intensity[t]`` and ``/decay[t]`` align.
