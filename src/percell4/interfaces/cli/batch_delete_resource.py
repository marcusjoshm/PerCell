"""CLI adapter: delete resources across .h5 datasets.

Headless front-end for
:func:`percell4.application.use_cases.batch_delete_resource.batch_delete_resource`.

Usage:
    # Delete one named resource per dataset.
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource dish_1.h5 dish_2.h5 \\
        --kind segmentation --name cellpose_qc
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource /scratch/dishes/ \\
        --kind mask --name thresh_488 --dry-run

    # Delete EVERY resource of a kind in each dataset.
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource /scratch/dishes/ \\
        --kind mask --all --dry-run
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource dish_1.h5 \\
        --kind channel --all

    # Delete FLIM phasor / wavelet resources (--name is the CHANNEL name).
    # Full reset (drops base g/s AND the wavelet output) — recompute phasor:
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource /scratch/dishes/ \\
        --kind phasor --name mNG
    # Wavelet only (keeps base g/s) — re-run Apply Wavelet Filter:
    python -m percell4.interfaces.cli.batch_delete_resource *.h5 \\
        --kind wavelet --all --dry-run

For each input .h5 (or every .h5 in a directory argument), the CLI
either deletes one ``(kind, name)`` pair (``--name``) or every
resource of ``--kind`` present in that file (``--all``). The two
flags are mutually exclusive; one is required. Datasets that don't
have the resource (or any resources of the kind for ``--all``) are
reported as skipped, not as failures. ``--dry-run`` classifies
exactly as a live run would but does not mutate any file.

Channels go through DatasetStore.delete_channel, which removes
/decay/<name>, /phasor/<name>, the channel_names metadata entry, and
the per-channel FLIM calibration attrs together. Masks and
segmentations go through DatasetStore.delete_item against
/masks/<name> and /labels/<name> respectively.

FLIM phasor resources are keyed by CHANNEL name (``--name mNG``):
``--kind phasor`` removes the entire /phasor/<channel> group (base
g/s AND the derived wavelet triple g_filtered/s_filtered/
lifetime_filtered); ``--kind wavelet`` removes only that triple,
leaving the base phasor intact so Apply Wavelet Filter can be re-run
without recomputing the phasor.

Exit codes:
    0 -- at least one dataset was successfully deleted
    1 -- every dataset was skipped or failed (no progress made)
