"""Shared helpers for batch-* CLIs (rename, delete).

Both ``percell-batch-rename`` and ``percell-batch-delete`` produce
the same shape of report — a list of per-dataset items, each with
status + processed/skipped/errors collections — and want to print
them the same way modulo the verb ("renamed" vs "deleted"). This
module is the one place those helpers live so the two CLIs stay in
lockstep.

``percell-batch-phasor`` predates this module and keeps its in-file
copies of these helpers for now. A follow-up could consolidate, but
the duplication is small and stable enough that it isn't worth a
breaking refactor on a different CLI's branch.
