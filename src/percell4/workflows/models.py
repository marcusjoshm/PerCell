a run is immutable, and runtime state (``RunMetadata``) lives in a separate

    instead of grouped Otsu / puncta / iterative-Otsu. The detector is driven by
    the smallest particle diameter to detect (``d_min_um``): it derives the
    local-background window and size filter, while the noise floor is a robust
    per-cell ``1.4826*MAD`` so a fixed ``k`` transfers across cells/datasets whose
    intensity scale varies many-fold.

    ``d_min_um`` holds that diameter *value*; ``d_min_unit`` ("um" default, or
    "px") says how to interpret it. In "um" mode the apply phase converts it to
    pixels via the dataset pixel size (so it transfers across magnifications); in
    "px" mode it is used as pixels directly — for datasets that lack a pixel size.
    (The ``_um`` suffix is the historical/default-unit name, not a hard unit.)

    ``presmooth_sigma_px`` is the detector's fixed-pixel presmooth (noise

    ``global_sigma`` (default False) swaps the per-cell noise floor for a single σ
    pooled over all cell pixels (``adaptive_clip.pooled_sigma``), so every cell is
    thresholded against one shared ``k*σ`` instead of its own MAD — the "global"
    mode. Use it when the per-cell σ over-adapts (e.g. cells that are uniformly
    dim get an inappropriately low floor); the default per-cell σ is what lets one
