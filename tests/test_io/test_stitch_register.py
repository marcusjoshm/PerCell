"""Tests for overlap-aware phase-correlation registration + offset placement.

Covers U3 of the mosaic-merge overlap-stitching plan: the three pure functions
``canvas_from_offsets`` / ``estimate_tile_offsets`` / ``assemble_tiles_with_offsets``
in ``percell4.domain.io.assembler``.

The AXIS-SWAP guard is load-bearing: the prior critical FLIM bug class came from
an ``(x, y) <-> (y, x)`` transposition, so an *asymmetric* shift must recover
``(y0, x0)`` in image-axis order, never swapped.
