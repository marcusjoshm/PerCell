"""Tests for DatasetStore.delete_channel.

Canonical channel-delete method that sweeps every per-channel surface
in one call: ``/decay/<name>``, ``/phasor/<name>/{g,s,...}``, removal
from ``channel_names`` metadata, and the per-channel FLIM calibration
attrs ``flim_cal_phase_<name>`` / ``flim_cal_mod_<name>``.

The method is the symmetric pair to ``rename_channel``. The seg-QC
recovery work already inlines this logic in the FastAPI ``/delete``
endpoint (on the ``feat/tauri-react-ui`` branch); this method
canonicalizes it so the batch CLI in U3 and the backend endpoint can
share one implementation.
