# Pin qtpy's binding before anything can import it. A dev machine often has
# PyQt5, PyQt6, and PySide6 installed at once (napari and its plugins pull
# different ones); without this qtpy picks whichever it finds first, so the
# suite passes, fails, or segfaults from run to run. CI installs only PyQt5,
# so pinning it here makes a local run reproduce CI rather than testing a
# configuration nobody ships. pytest-qt's own binding is pinned via the
# ``qt_api`` ini option in pyproject.toml — both are needed, they select
# independently.
#
# setdefault, not assignment: an explicit QT_API in the environment still wins,
# so it stays possible to check binding portability deliberately.
os.environ.setdefault("QT_API", "pyqt5")

# pyqtgraph does NOT honour QT_API — it runs its own binding detection and will
# happily import PyQt6 when PyQt6 is installed, even with QT_API=pyqt5. Two
# bindings loaded into one process abort with SIGABRT the moment both try to
# own the Qt event loop, which is what made a full local run die partway
# through tests/test_gui while the same directory passed when run alone.
os.environ.setdefault("PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB", "PyQt5")

# Render to an offscreen buffer instead of the desktop. Without this, a run
# put real windows on screen and took focus — 13 modules call .show() directly
# and roughly as many more reach it through production code, e.g.
# MultiSelectController.show() does show(); raise_(); activateWindow().
#
# This works only because the tests that build a real napari.Viewer now live in
# tests_gui/. macOS offscreen provides no OpenGL context, so a viewer built
# under it segfaults (exit 139, no traceback) rather than failing — which is
# why an earlier attempt at this concluded offscreen was unusable and reverted
# it. The order matters: quarantine first, then offscreen.
#
# Expect "QOpenGLWidget is not supported on this platform." on stderr. It is
# benign for the widget tests that remain here; if it is followed by a crash,
# something GL-dependent has leaked back into tests/ and the autouse guard in
# this file will name it.
#
# setdefault, like the pins above: QT_QPA_PLATFORM=cocoa pytest still runs
# windowed, which is the way to watch a layout problem happen.
os.environ.setdefault("QT_QPA_PLATFORM", "offscreen")

# Qt assumes 96 DPI under the offscreen platform while macOS lays out on a
# 72pt basis, so the same widget measures about 25% wider offscreen (average
# char width 10 vs 8, line height 20 vs 16). Several tests assert a pixel
# budget — "this form fits a standard window width" — and those assertions
# would otherwise mean something different from what the researcher sees.
#
# Pinning the font DPI restores the macOS basis. An environment variable
# rather than a fixture because there is no ordering hazard: it must be set
# before the QApplication is constructed, and pytest-qt builds that during
# fixture setup, after any autouse fixture we could write here.

# ── No napari viewer under tests/ ───────────────────────────────────
#
# Every test here runs under QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen, which provides no
# OpenGL context on macOS. A real ``napari.Viewer`` built under it does not
# fail — it segfaults, exit 139, with no traceback and no attribution. Tests
# that need one live in ``tests_gui/``.
#
# Grep cannot police that boundary. ``test_dilute_phase_workflow_sidebar.py``
# mentioned neither napari nor ViewerWindow, yet built a real
# ``LauncherWindow`` that owns a ``ViewerWindow``; a queued handler then read
# ``.viewer`` and constructed the canvas, sometimes during a *later* test's
# setup. It passed alone and segfaulted when run after another module. So the
# rule is enforced dynamically, at the constructor.
#
# Record *before* raising. That ordering is required, not defensive:
# ``segmentation_panel`` wraps the same access in ``try: ... except
# Exception: return``, which would swallow a raise-only guard at precisely the
# site worth catching and report a clean run. The fixture below inspects the
# record, so a swallowed raise still fails the test that caused it.
