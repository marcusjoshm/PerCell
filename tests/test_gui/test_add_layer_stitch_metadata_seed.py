"""Tests for seeding AddLayerDialog's TCSPC stitch controls from /metadata (U2).

This path had NO coverage before this refactor, which is why it warranted its
own file. It is the sharpest edge in the consolidation: the seeding used to
locate combo entries with ``findText`` and now uses ``findData``, and a miss is
**silent** — ``idx < 0`` simply skips ``setCurrentIndex``, leaving the default
selected with no error. Because that seeded geometry places decay tiles relative
to already-stitched intensity, a silent fallback misaligns ``/decay`` against
``/intensity`` — the failure class
``docs/solutions/logic-errors/flim-phasor-cross-layer-alignment-2026-04-29.md``
exists to prevent.

Every assertion here therefore checks the **resulting TileConfig**, never a
combo index.
