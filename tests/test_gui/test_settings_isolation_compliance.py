"""Codebase invariant: ``QSettings`` is constructed in exactly one place.

Window geometry and remembered dialog choices persist to a per-user store. On
macOS that store is the live CFPreferences domain
``com.LeeLabPerCell4.PerCell4``, and the two-argument ``QSettings(org, app)``
constructor reaches it no matter what ``setDefaultFormat`` or ``setPath`` say —
both are ignored for the native format.

That is why three test modules could carry an ``isolated_settings`` fixture,
believe they were sandboxed, and still ``clear()`` the researcher's real saved
window layout. Running the suite rearranged their desktop.

The fix is structural rather than careful: one factory,
``percell4.gui.settings.app_settings``, which the test suite redirects once for
the whole session. A second construction site anywhere would silently escape
that redirect and reintroduce the bug, so this test forbids one.

Asserted by inspection, the same way ``test_qt_free_imports.py`` asserts the
hexagonal import boundary and ``test_signal_lifetime_compliance.py`` asserts
the signal-connection shapes.
