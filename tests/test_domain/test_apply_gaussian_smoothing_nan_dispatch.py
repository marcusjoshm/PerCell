"""U2 regression tests for apply_gaussian_smoothing's NaN-aware dispatch.

The dilute-phase workflow's per-round working buffer contains NaN
where prior rounds have subtracted condensed-phase pixels. Every
consumer of apply_gaussian_smoothing must handle that input
correctly without poisoning the entire smoothed image.

Strategy: clean inputs MUST take the existing scipy fast path
unchanged (bit-equivalent legacy behavior; pinned to guard against
silent drift). NaN inputs MUST be routed through the U1 NaN-safe
helper so finite pixels stay finite even when neighbors are NaN.
